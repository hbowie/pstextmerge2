Body:

Added a new data input format, called PSPub Outline. This format allows an outline to be easily created within any text editor. Any character may be used consistently within a file as a bullet character, to indicate a heading item. Indention is used to indicate outline levels. The output may then be formatted as HTML, in any format that the user chooses.
