Body:

For HTML input, added ability to translate character entities found within HTML text to their equivalent ASCII characters. For now, translation is only provided for characters that are not platform-specific: &nbsp; (non-breaking space), &lt; (less than sign),  &gt; (greater than sign),  &amp; (ampersand) and &quot; (double quotation marks). Entities may be specified using mnemonics or their numeric equivalents.
