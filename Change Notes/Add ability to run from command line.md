Body:

Added two command line arguments, to allow PSTextMerge to be run completely from the command line, without any graphical user interface. The first argument is specified as -q and tells the program to run in quiet mode -- that is, without any GUI. The second argument specifies the location and name of a script file to be played, the location being relative to the PSTextMerge program.
